# NetRoute-Optimizer
A comparative framework for Quality of Service (QoS) routing using Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning in complex network topologies
# OrbitalComm Command Center: QoS Routing Optimizer

This project focuses on finding the optimal path in a communication network based on multiple constraints: **Delay, Reliability, and Resource Costs**. It features a Streamlit-based UI to visualize and compare different optimization meta-heuristics.

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Multi-Algorithm Support:** Implementation of Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Q-Learning (RL).
* **Custom Network Generation:** Dynamic creation of network topologies with up to 250 nodes.
* **Interactive UI:** Real-time visualization using Streamlit and Plotly.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Automated benchmarking tools to evaluate algorithm performance (latency, success rate, execution time).

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python 3.x**
* **NetworkX** (Graph management)
* **Streamlit** (Dashboard)
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data processing)
* **Plotly** (3D/2D visualization)
